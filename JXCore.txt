run the following commands from console before starting

curl http://jxcore.com/xil.sh | bash
jx install querystring ws http fs sys

The first line installs JXcore, the second line installs the node require files.
You only would need do that once. So once you have those installed you can
run the server from command line usingthe command

jx index.js

or ./runserver.sh to start it looped.
